Dear Kinkar, 

How are you? Hope you are set to visit us. If you are planning to come with 
your laptop please try to install following softwares 

1. root
2. LHAPDF (I had used version 5.8.8 for the charmonia calculations)
3. emacs

If you face any problem while doing this please let me know.

Vineet
