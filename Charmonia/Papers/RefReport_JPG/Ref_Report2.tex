\begin{document}
List of changes made: 

Referee: 1  I strongly recommend to refrain from citing individual papers on quarkonia in heavy-ion collisions, but replace those by a couple of review articles on this topic.
The references [2] and [4] are replaced by review articles. 

We are not including the appendix (listing cross section formulae published elsewhere) in the final version of the manuscript. The appendix was provided in 2nd version. The formulae given in the appendix are already published and references are given so in principle it is not required as part of the manuscript.
