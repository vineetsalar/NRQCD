\section{Results}
\label{sec:results}


The $\jpsi$ and $\psiprime$ non-prompt and prompt production cross-sections are presented, corrected for acceptance and detector efficiencies 
while assuming isotropic decay, as described in Section~\ref{sec:s:diff_xSecDet}. 
Also presented are the ratios of non-prompt production relative to the inclusive production for $\jpsi$ and $\psiprime$ mesons separately, described in Section~\ref{sec:s:NPFDet},
and the ratio of $\psiprime$ to $\jpsi$ production for prompt and non-prompt components separately, described in Section~\ref{sec:s:PNPRatioDet}.
Correction factors for various spin-alignment hypotheses for both 7 and 8~\TeV\  data can be found in 
Tables~\ref{tab:sa_long_jpsi}--\ref{tab:sa_offN_psi2s} (in Appendix) and Tables~\ref{tab:sa_long_jpsi8}--\ref{tab:sa_offN_psi2s8} (in Appendix) respectively, in terms of 
\pt\ and rapidity intervals.

\item[Production cross-sections] \hfill

Figures \ref{fig:res:xSecP} and \ref{fig:res:xSecNP} show respectively the prompt and non-prompt 
differential cross-sections of \jpsi\ and \psiprime\ as functions of $\pt$ and $|y|$, together with the relevant theoretical predictions, 
which are described below.

\item[Non-prompt production fractions] \hfill % \\

The results for the fractions of non-prompt production relative to the inclusive production of \jpsi\ and \psiprime\, are presented as a function of $\pt$ for slices of rapidity in Figure~\ref{fig:res:NPF}. 
In each rapidity slice, the non-prompt fraction is seen to increase as a function of $\pt$ and has no strong dependence on either rapidity or centre-of-mass energy.

\textit{Production ratios of \textmd{\psiprime} to \textmd{\jpsi} }

Figure~\ref{fig:res:PNP_Ratio} shows the ratios of \psiprime\ to \jpsi\ decaying to a muon pair in prompt and non-prompt processes,
 presented as a function of $\pt$ for slices of rapidity. The non-prompt ratio is shown to be relatively flat across the considered range of $\pT$,
for each slice of rapidity.
For the prompt ratio, a slight increase as a function of $\pt$ is observed, with no strong dependence on rapidity or centre-of-mass energy.

\item[Comparison with theory] \hfill \\
For prompt production, as shown in Figure~\ref{fig:xsecPtheoryRatio}, the ratio of the NLO NRQCD theory calculations~\cite{Shao:2012iz} 
to data is provided for \Jpsi\ and \psiprime\ at both the 7 and 8~\TeV\ centre-of-mass energies.
The theory predictions are 
based on the long-distance matrix elements (LDMEs) from Refs.~\cite{NRQCD1,Ma:2010vd}, with uncertainties originating from the
choice of scale, charm quark mass and LDMEs (see Refs.~\cite{Shao:2012iz,Kanaki:2000ey,NRQCD1,Ma:2010vd} for more details).
Figure~\ref{fig:xsecPtheoryRatio} shows fair agreement between the theoretical calculation and the data points for the whole $\pt$ range. 
The ratio of theory to data does not depend on rapidity.

For non-prompt $\psi$ production, comparisons are made to FONLL theoretical predictions~\cite{FONLL_2001,Cacciari:2012ny}, which describe the production of 
$b$-hadrons followed by their decay into $\psi+X$.
Figure~\ref{fig:xsecNPtheoryRatio} shows the ratios of $\jpsi$ and $\psiprime$ FONLL predictions to data, as a function of $\pt$ and in slices of rapidity, 
for centre-of-mass energies of~7 and 8~\TeV.
For $\jpsi$, agreement is generally good, but the theory predicts slightly harder $\pt$ spectra than observed in the data.
For $\psiprime$, the shapes of data and theory appear to be in satisfactory agreement, but the theory predicts higher yields than in the data.
There is no observed dependence on rapidity in the comparisons between theory and data for non-prompt \jpsi\ and \psiprime\ production.

\item[Comparison of cross-sections 8~\TeV\  with 7~\TeV\ ] \hfill \\

It is interesting to compare the cross-section results between the two centre-of-mass energies, for both data and the theoretical predictions.

Figure~\ref{fig:xsecEnergyRatio} shows the 8~\TeV\  to 7~\TeV\  cross-section ratios of prompt and non-prompt $\jpsi$ and $\psiprime$ for both data sets.
For the theoretical ratios the uncertainties are neglected here, since the high correlation between them results in large cancellations.


Due to a finer granularity in $\pt$ for the 8~\TeV\  data, a weighted average of the 8~\TeV\ results is taken across equivalent intervals of the 7~\TeV\ data to enable direct comparisons.
Both data and theoretical predictions agree 
that the ratios become larger with increasing $\pt$,
however at the lower edge of the $\pT$ range the data tends to be slightly below theory.
